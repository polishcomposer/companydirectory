**Functionality**

Application allows for the maintenance of a company personnel database to see who’s who, which department they are in and where they are.

**Guidelines for the Project**

A more rigorous reply to this specification was required as a user requirements document was needed to be prepared which, when signed off, triggers the release of SQL allowing to develop a “mobile-first” application to maintain a company personnel database (MySQL). Sign off is only achieved upon the student supplying an independently witnessed document providing confirmation of the system’s ability to perform error free.
